## General

- [ ] Work with cloudinary to upload images from frontend to backend and set the url in the animal_images
      Instead of updating animals from 1 call make 2 calls, one to create the animal and one to create animal images
      the one for images should send the animal id and the image.

## Frontend

- [x] Call /cards to get a card on page load, and set the cards image instead of hard coding it

## Backend

- [x] set up a route that returns a random animal? (route could be GET /cards instead of POST)
- [ ] users route should check for post and then
